# WORKING ON IT

Right now, my digital portfolio is still on progress. I'm gonna try to make it informative and simple in the best way. Implementing accessbility and WCAG also one of my priority. My plan would be using HTML, CSS (Sass), and JavaScript. I want to make it clear and clean that's why I try to minimize technology that I use. However, it might be change in the future cause it depends how my process throught all of this.

Anyway, It will be my first digital portfolio, so I cannot wait to see how it goes.

Today is mark as day one. What I do is trying to make a skeleton of my homepage. I already set up my `sass` using `npm script` by Stephanie Eckles [click here](https://thinkdobecreate.com/articles/minimum-static-site-sass-setup/). Inside `index.html` I created navbar that is still raw without any styles. My points is trying to get links works each files. So far, I'm fine with them.

In this week, I try to adjust myself with new Sass rules. My option using `npm script` is great. Creating and organizing my Sass hard at first, but easier after that. Using `@use` and `@forward` became convinient after couple times. The styles are not final. I just want to get my hands to be familiar with all the new things fron Sass. Here are resources that help me to set up my sass:

- Sass guidelines [click here](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) by Kitty Giraudel.
- I try to following [this boilerplate](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate) by Kitty Giraudel to organizing the functionality of each folder.
- My `_reset.scss` is inspired by Andy Bell [click here](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/).
- [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOnYNEXv9BM&t=124s) by coder coder on how to use `@use` and `@forward`

I haven't touch the JavaScript yet. My main focus this week is get to know the styles before comes down to the JavaScript.
